		<h1>About</h1>
			<p class="info">The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the world significantly. With safety precautions put into place in the different parts of the world, social distancing has become the most common way of limiting the spread of the virus. The problem nowadays is the lack of social distancing awareness because one might be having too much fun or does not realize how close they are to a friend or stranger. 6FT is an app that aims to solve that problem by using the proximity sensor on phones to alert the user to social distance with the people they are around. The user has the ability to limit the notification frequency to their comfort level with options to toggle on/off.</p>
